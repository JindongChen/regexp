<h2>Differences</h2>
<h3>between</h3>
<h3>grep, egrep, fgrep and pgrep</h3>

---

<h3>grep</h3>
- Stands for "Global Regular Expressions Print".
- Is a program which scans a specified file or files line by line, returning lines that contain a pattern.

The standard grep command looks like:</br>
<pre>
grep &lt flags &gt '&lt regular expression &gt' &lt filename &gt
</pre>
grep prints the search results to the screen (stdout) and returns the following
exit values:
<pre>
0    A match was found.
1    No match was found.
>1   A syntax error was found or a file was inaccessible
     (even if matches were found).
</pre>
Some common flags are:
<pre>
-c   Count the number of successful matches, not printing the actual matches
-i   Make the search case insensitive
-n   Print the line number before each match printout
-v   Take the complement of the regular expression
     (i.e. return the lines which don't match)
-l   Print the file names of files with lines which match the expression.
-s   Slient mode. Noexistent and unreadable files are ignored
     (i.e. their error messages are suppressed)
</pre>

<h3>egrep</h3>
- Stands for "Extended Global Regular Expressions Print".

The 'E' in egrep means treat the pattern as a regular expression. "Extended
Regular Expressions" abbreviated 'ERE' is enabled in egrep. <span class=red>egrep (which is the
  same as grep -E) treats +, ?, |, (, and ) as meta-characters.</span>
In basic regular expressions (with grep), the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (,
and ) lose their special meaning. If you want grep to treat these characters as
meta-characters, escape them \?, \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).
For example, here grep uses basic regular expressions where the plus is treated
literally, any line with a plus in it is returned.
<pre> grep "+" myfile.txt </pre>
egrep on the other hand treats the "+" as a meta character and returns every
line because plus is interpreted as "one or more times".
<pre> egrep "+" myfile.txt </pre>
Here every line is returned because the + was treated by egrep as a meta
character. normal grep would have searched only for lines with a literal +.

---

<h3>fgrep</h3>
- Stands for "Fixed-string Global Regular Expressions Print".

<span class=red>fgrep (which is the same as grep -F) is fixed or fast grep and behaves as grep
but does NOT recognize any regular expression meta-characters as being
special.</span>
The search will complete faster because it only processes a simple string
rather than a complex pattern.
For example, if I wanted to search my .bash_profile for a literal dot (.) then
using grep would be difficult because I would have to escape the dot because
dot is a meta character that means 'wild-card, any single character':
<pre> grep "." myfile.txt </pre>
The above command returns every line of myfile.txt. Do this instead:
<pre> fgrep "." myfile.txt </pre>
Then only the lines that have a literal '.' in them are returned. fgrep helps
us not bother escaping our meta characters.

---

<h3>pgrep</h3>

- Stands for "Process-ID Global Regular Expressions Print".

pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs
which matches the selection criteria to stdout. pgrep is handy when all you
want to know is the process id integer of a process. For example, if I wanted
to know only the process ID of my mysql process I would use the command
<pre> pgrep mysql </pre>
which would return a process ID like 7312.
